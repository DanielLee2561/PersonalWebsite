What I Have Always Wanted To Say 

I never thought the sky could look so beautiful, before that day... 

I was blushing, nervous. You asked me out, something I've been waiting to hear forever and ever. I was waiting to ask you too, but I didn't know how you would react. 
Then when you brought me there, to the place where the sun and clouds in the sky seemed almost like a distant fantasy. The waves brushing up against the shore, and the way your hair glowed like the sun. 
You were too perfect for someone like me, I always knew that in my heart. You never needed me, but still we were here together. Hand-in-hand watching the waves...

It was the closest I could ever ask, being near you. You asked me how I felt and if I could tell you now I would say it was special to me. 
You gave me hope when I had none. Brought something special into my life, even now I would like nothing more than to disappear into that memory... 

When you... asked me, how I felt. The words struggled in my mouth. 
How could I tell you? 
The regret has always stayed pictured in my mind along with the feelings I wanted to say. 

Before we left, I had one last look at you. Like a distant lover, or a stalker. We were closer then, but far. 

What I really wanted to say that day was... 

I love you, Arianna. 

I love you.
