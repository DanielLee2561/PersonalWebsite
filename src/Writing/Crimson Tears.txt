Crimson Tears

A weight settles in my heart, growing heavier with each step. 
  
My hands which aren't shaking, 
and my eyes that have soon lost their warmth. 

If I could cry I would, 
but no tears can fall. 
And If I could scream I would, 
but no voice escapes this sound. 
 
All that's left in this field of battle are crimson tears,  
from red rivers flowing, and green now stained amber and red.  
The bodies of our allies, our friends we're counting, 
amongst the bodies of the dead.
